# KNN-for-iris-Flower
Implementing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classifying iris flowers. Utilizes the popular iris dataset for training and testing. Python implementation with scikit-learn library. Educational and practical for beginners

## DataSet information
![68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f505171594761572e706e67](https://github.com/778569/KNN-for-iris-Flower-Machine-Learning-/assets/52319671/3c40eae2-c229-488b-baa3-3557b863c5f2)

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

* Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.
* This is an exceedingly simple domain.

This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick, spchadwick '@' espeedaz.net ). The 35th sample should be: 4.9,3.1,1.5,0.2,"Iris-setosa" where the error is in the fourth feature. The 38th sample: 4.9,3.6,1.4,0.1,"Iris-setosa" where the errors are in the second and third features.

## Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. petal length in cm
4. petal width in cm
5. class: -- Iris Setosa -- Iris Versicolour -- Iris Virginica
